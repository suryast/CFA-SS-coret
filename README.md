## Rationale
This is a project that I initiated as part of Coders' Factory Academy bootcamp. The main goal of this exercise is demonstrate my ability as an aspiring full-stack developer to demonstrate that I can can build a complete Rails application from design through to deployment, using appropriate tools and methodologies.

Scope of the exercise – my application must impress one person/group from this list:
  1. Barack Obama (politics)
  2. Rupert Murdoch (journalism)
  3. Bill & Melinda Gates (social causes/global development)

I wanted to build prototype for a real project, so I asked my friend Ina Andira – who runs her non-profit organisation in Indonesia called [**Rumah Cerita**](https://www.facebook.com/rumahceritaorg/)(est. 2015) – how I could help her.

## What is Rumah Cerita?
**Rumah Cerita** is a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting students ages six to eighteen with their creative and expository writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write. Through a range of innovative writing programmes, and one-to-one mentoring, we help young people discover and realise their own creative potential. We build confidence, self-respect and communication skills in both workshops for schools and out-of-school writing clubs.

**Rumah Cerita** (*The Story House*) is inspired by organisations from around the world like:
- [826 Valencia, San Fransisco](http://826valencia.org/)
- [The Ministry of Stories, London](http://ministryofstories.org/) – has Story Engine has been co-designed and developed with the collaboration of teachers, students, writers, designers, educators, academics, filmmakers and other specialists.
- [The Sydney Story Factory, Sydney](http://www.sydneystoryfactory.org.au/) – has school holiday workshops

## Vision and Mission
To facilitate young generations of Indonesia to write and to create.

To achieve the vision, **Rumah Cerita** has the following mission statements:
  1. To host creative writing workshop and other creative workshops for young Indonesians starting in the town of Bandung.
  2. To collect stories written by young Indonesians and publish them so that the work can be read and heard nationally and internationally.
  3. To become a community for young Indonesians who want to contribute to their country in the filed of literacy, arts and culture.

## Approach
The programs have five prongs that are either ongoing or planned for the future:

  1. Free face-to-face writing and drawing workshops for under-resourced students – ongoing main project.
  2. Paid writing workshops delivered to established schools – initiative to explore.

  3. **Festival Cerita Jakarta** by Rumah Cerita

      Annual children writing festival to subsidise for approach #1. This initiative received $10K funding in early 2017 from the Australian Government through Australia Awards. The inaugural festival will be held in November 2017. This initiative needs an event+registration platform.

  4. **Student Press Online** by Rumah Cerita

      This curated media platform would host and exhibit digital work of school kids who are involved in producing student press for their respective schools. The platform would also enable young writers to connect with trained mentors, and allows schools who may not be within reach locally to get inspired and benefit from our work – initiative to explore.

  5. **Coret** by Rumah Cerita

      Marketplace for selling fashion products that are inspired by writings and artworks of kids that are involved in writing and drawing workshops. The profit from sale will be shared with the creator of the original work. Each product would have a note that contains short story behind each work as written by the kids themselves – initiative to explore.

## Roadblocks
- Need sustainable funding to keep run free face-to-face workshops for under-resourced students.
- No system in place yet for approach #2, #3, #4 and #5.

## Solution and scope provided by this project
- Implement platform **Coret** by Rumah Cerita.

## Wireframes
I used sketch to the wireframes. You can find the UI prototypes here https://invis.io/WFBBYX9YM – best viewed in mobile.

## Project plan and estimation
I estimated that the core, production ready, prototype would take 120 agile points to build including UX and UI deasign and it would definitely take more than 2 weeks I had been allocated :D – you can't learn unless you set your bar high. Additional features of the core build will take additional 50 points. Overall, I think this project would need approximately 170 agile points to a point where I would be satisfied.
